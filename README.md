Home Assistant OpenAI Response Sensor
This custom component for Home Assistant allows you to generate text responses using OpenAI's GPT-3 model.

Installation
Copy the openai_response folder to your Home Assistant's custom_components directory. If you don't have a custom_components directory, create one in the same directory as your configuration.yaml file.

Add the following lines to your Home Assistant configuration.yaml file:

yaml
Copy code
sensor:
  - platform: openai_response
    api_key: YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
    model: "text-davinci-003" # Optional, defaults to "text-davinci-003"
    name: "hassio_openai_response" # Optional, defaults to "hassio_openai_response"
Replace YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY with your actual OpenAI API key.

Restart Home Assistant.
Usage
Create an input_text entity in Home Assistant to serve as the input for the GPT-3 model. For example, add the following lines to your configuration.yaml file:

yaml
Copy code
input_text:
  gpt_input:
    name: GPT-3 Input
To generate a response from GPT-3, update the input_text.gpt_input entity with the text you want to send to the model. The generated response will be available as an attribute of the sensor.hassio_openai_response entity.

Example
To display the GPT-3 input and response in your Home Assistant frontend, add the following to your ui-lovelace.yaml file or create a card in the Lovelace UI:

yaml
Copy code
type: vertical-stack
cards:
  - type: entities
    entities:
      - entity: input_text.gpt_input
  - type: entities
    entities:
      - entity: sensor.hassio_openai_response
        attribute: response_text
Now you can type your text in the GPT-3 Input field, and the generated response will be displayed in the response card.
